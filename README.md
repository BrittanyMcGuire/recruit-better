# Recruit Better
One stop shop for recruiting resources. Essentially, I was loosing track of where I was keeping all of this info and and wanted it in one place selfishly for myself. However, why not open this up for your use too?

Do you have a resource to add? Thank you! Let's do that. This is open source and I don't have as much time on my hands as I would like to. So if something is borken or if you want to add to the list, please contribute with a pull request.

👉 I'm always learning and adding new things so either I can remember them, or you can use them. I didn't find all this myself and heartfully thank all those in the recruitment community that provided help along the way.
